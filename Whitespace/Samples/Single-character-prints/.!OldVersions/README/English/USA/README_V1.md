# Temporary pause

I temporarily paused this after finishing `i` and `I` as it was becoming too repetitive, and I might have made errors (such as improperly defining characters in binary) once I can confirm it is correct/fix it, it can be resumed. The binary code in project language files can easily be fixed too if it is wrong, a simple `CTRL` + `H` and a replacement code for each individual character should fix it right up.
